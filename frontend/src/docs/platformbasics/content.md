### INTRODUCTION

### What is BTES?

BTES is an educational web-based platform about blockchain technology, catering towards absolutely everyone. With a simplified blockchain simulation; we will portray the exact structures of real-world blockchains, without suffocating the user with expert-level technical information.

### What is Project Purpose?
Our aim is making a educational web-based platform about blockchain technology, catering towards absolutely everyone.

### Which Devices Do Support BTES?
 BTES is basically an application that uses web-based with blockchain technology.
